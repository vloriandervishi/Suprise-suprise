# Rick and Morty API Phase 1 Project

# User Story

As a user I want application that pulls information from a external api and displays Rick and Morty's Characters. After the page is loaded and I click the page it will render different pictures characters of the show. At the same time, as I hover over the characters information under the image it will change the background and the font colors. Last of all, as a user,I want to move around the characters information vertically and horizontally.
