# Rick and Morty API Phase 1 Project

# User Story

As a user, I want information from an external API that displays Rick and Morty's Characters. After the page is loaded and I click the page it will render different pictures characters of the show. At the same time, as I hover over the characters' information under the image it will change the font colors. Last of all, as a user, I want to with arrow keys to move around the character's information vertically and horizontally.
